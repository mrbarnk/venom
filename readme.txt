    WELCOME DEARIE!!!
::::::::::::::::::::::

Hello! Thank you for downloading this beta version of SchoolDMS. The script was built to basically allow school owners to create their online presence easily and quickly. Though it is still undergoing development, the developer has ensured that the basic features a typical school website needs are implemented such as pages, news updates, staff organisation, role assignment, feedback by visitors, etc.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
WHO SHOULD USE THIS SCRIPT? 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The script is specifically developed to help private school owners to easily create their online presence. For example, instead of hiring a developer to create your school website, you can simply install this script and boom! your school website is ready!!! Sounds easy right? Of course yes.

My nane is Etom Usang (aka Laive). I developed this script to help school proprietors to establish an online presence for their schools which is one way of ensuring that the school gains more exposure.

HOW TO INSTALL THIS SCRIPT
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

I painstakenly took my time to ensure that installing SCHOOLDMS doesn't take more than 3 minutes! Yeah, I mean less than 3 minutes. All you have to do is follow the 7 EASY steps below and you'll be surprised how easy it is to install SCHOOLDMS. Ready? Let's go!!

::::::
STEP 1
::::::

After downloading the zip file, just unzip it and move to step two. 

::::::
STEP 2
::::::

After unzipping, you can rename the root folder to anything you want but without white spaces, e.g. my_school, science_school, etc. but here we assume the root folder is named as SchoolDMS.

::::::
STEP 3
::::::

Now open the 'database.php' file located in [root folder] => application => config and enter your database configuration details for password and username. Also remember to provide your database name. Without these 3 details, you will not be able to install SCHOOLDMS.

::::::
STEP 4
::::::

Now, the next thing to do is to specify your base URL. This is necessary because SCHOOLDMS will need to know where to serve pages from. To specify your base URL, open the file, 'config.php' located in [root folder] => application => config. Specify your base URL in full. 

For example, if your website domain name is 'http://example.com', your base URL in this case will be 'http://example.com/folder_name/'. Notice that 'folder_name' is the EXACT folder name you specified in STEP 2 above. Remember to include the folder name with one trailing slash as indicated above.

::::::
STEP 5
::::::
After, effecting the above changes, proceed to upload the folder to the root folder of your web server. If you are not confident with this, invite a qualified developer to help you or search Google for the steps.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
STEP 6 - LET'S NOW INSTALL!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now, assuming you did everything correctly as indicated above, then you we are good to go! Simply point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/folder_name/index.php/installer/run .
:::::::::::
EXPLANATION
:::::::::::

1. 'yourdomain.com' is just a place holder for your domain name. It could well be anything like a subdomain, etc. But here, we use 'yourdomain.com'

2. 'folder_name' is the folder name you specified in STEP 2 above. Nothing more.

3. 'index.php' is required for now and in fact, you will see this segment in all your links for now. Please include this segment because it is required to avoid errors.

4. 'installer/run' is just an command to initialize the installation process. It's just like giving a child a piece of chocolate candy and then telling him to eat. In that case your segment will be: 
'take/eat'. But here it is 'installer/run'.

::::::
STEP 7
::::::

If you entered the URL correctly, you should see a 'Thumbs Up!' screen telling you that SCHOOLDMS installed successfully. Just follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. It's extremely simple.
